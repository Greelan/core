Create a file (with .conf extension) in this directory to configure trusted IPs for the mod_extforward
module in lighttpd. The mod_extforward module extracts the "real" IPs of clients connecting to the OPNsense
webgui through a reverse proxy, using (by default) the Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-For headers. This is
useful for ensuring that the OPNsense webgui logs the "real" IPs of the clients rather than the IP(s)
of the reverse proxy.

The format for the .conf file is as follows:

extforward.forwarder = (                                                                
  "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" => "trust",                                                         
  "xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx:xxxx" => "trust"                                 
)

In this example, the "xxx" and "xxxx" entries represent the IPv4 and IPv6 IPs of the reverse proxy. Include 
as many IPs (IPv4 and/or IPv6) as are relevant.
